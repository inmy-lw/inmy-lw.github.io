# Various regular events

## Honorable Campaign

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnBpYbmbjw" target="_blank">Explanatory video</a>

To progress across the 3 paths at roughly the same pace, it’s recommended to use your T1 on one troop type to gain 2 stages per week. For example:
- Tuesday: 2 new Tank stages; 1 previously cleared stage on Aircraft and Missile
- Thursday: 2 new Aircraft stages; 1 previously cleared stage on Tank and Missile
- Sunday: 2 new Missile stages; 1 previously cleared stage on Tank and Aircraft

On a brand‑new stage, the game shows the estimated power needed to clear it. However, this information is not shown for a stage you’ve already completed.

At the very end of this page, you’ll find the estimated power values for every stage of the campaign.

## Marshal's Guard

The Marshal is an alliance event that takes place every two days. The goal is to rally to deal as much damage as possible.

1. The goal is to reach stage 5 to get the best possible rewards.
2. Button to start a rally. Rally timers are always 3 minutes.
3. Button to check the rewards obtained by the alliance and individually.

The first strategy is to start a rally with T2, and to join a rally with T1.

## Train

It is possible to take the train every day. Each carriage has different types of resources. You can choose the carriage you want to travel in.

You need to hand in trade tickets (the same ones used to send UR trucks).

A carriage has 5 seats. If more than 5 people try to enter the same carriage, the passengers are chosen at random.

Once the tickets are handed in, it is possible to change carriage (by selecting a new one) until departure.
