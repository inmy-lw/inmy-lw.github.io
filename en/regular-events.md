The Marshal is an alliance event that takes place every two days. The goal is to rally to deal as much damage as possible.

1. The goal is to reach stage 5 to get the best possible rewards.
2. Button to start a rally. Rally timers are always 3 minutes.
3. Button to check the rewards obtained by the alliance and individually.

The first strategy is to start a rally with T2, and to join a rally with T1.

## Train

It is possible to take the train every day. Each carriage has different types of resources. You can choose the carriage you want to travel in.

You need to hand in trade tickets (the same ones used to send UR trucks).

A carriage has 5 seats. If more than 5 people try to enter the same carriage, the passengers are chosen at random.

Once the tickets are handed in, it is possible to change carriage (by selecting a new one) until departure.
