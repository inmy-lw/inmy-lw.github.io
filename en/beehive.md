# Return to the hive
To return to the hive, you must take advantage of the free transportation offered on Saturdays during the VS.

Once that day has passed, you must purchase an advanced TP in the alliance store to return to the hive.

# Disposition de la ruche

In yellow are R4 & R5.

In blue, the stronger other than R4 & R5.

In green are the others.

# Pourquoi du comment

This provision allows R4 and R5 to travel shorter distances to the marshal and therefore offer more rallies. R4 & R5 vehicles offer an attack boost of `+2.5%` or `+5%` in their rallies, which benefits us all! 😉
