# Building priority

Focus primarily on HQ with the buildings required to upgrade HQ level.

# Queue rental

WIP

# Resource buildings

Use when you have multiple construction queues.

# Barracks management

Barracks levels must be “staggered”: each barracks must be able to produce a different unit level.

If you can produce level 8 units, then you must have:
1. A level 24-26 barracks (which can train T8s)
2. A level 20-23 barracks (which can train T7s)
3. A level 17-19 barracks (which can train T6s)
4. A level 14-16 barracks (which can train T5s)

The principle is to train units for each barracks that are one level below the barracks. In the previous case, we will train:
1. T7s
2. T6s
3. T5s
4. T4s

And this will continue throughout the week, until Friday, when the barracks will be used solely for promotion:
1. T7 to T8
2. T6 to T7
3. T5 to T6
4. T4 to T5
