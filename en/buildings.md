# Building priority

Focus primarily on the HQ with the buildings required to raise the HQ level.

## Mandatory buildings to raise HQ level (1 - 30)

# Queue rental

The game offers 4 construction queues. The first is available to everyone by default, while the other three are paid. As your HQ level increases, buildings will take longer and longer to construct.

However, it is possible to temporarily (for 2 hours) obtain a second construction queue for 500 diamonds. The trick with this queue is to rent it when starting very long upgrades, since the queue will only disappear after 2 hours — and only once it becomes inactive.

# Resource buildings

Use when you have multiple construction queues.

# Barracks management

<a href="https://youtu.be/ajbNCrJF5N0?t=547" target="_blank">Explanatory video</a>

Barracks levels must be “staggered”: each barracks must be able to produce a different unit level.

If you can produce level 8 units, then you must have:
1. A level 24-26 barracks (which can train T8s)
2. A level 20-23 barracks (which can train T7s)
3. A level 17-19 barracks (which can train T6s)
4. A level 14-16 barracks (which can train T5s)

The principle is to train units for each barracks that are one level below the barracks. In the previous case, we will train:
1. T7s
2. T6s
3. T5s
4. T4s

And this will continue throughout the week, until Friday, when the barracks will be used solely for promotion:
1. T7 to T8
2. T6 to T7
3. T5 to T6
4. T4 to T5
