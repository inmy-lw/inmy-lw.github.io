# Avoid opening gifts by accident

Opening gifts (accepting the completion of a building) yields a lot of points for the VS. So you want to have as many gifts as possible to open on Tuesday. There is a setting to prevent accidental gift openings:

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/tips/confirmation_ouverture_cadeau.webp" description="Enable confirmation when opening a gift" %}

Once this setting is enabled, this confirmation popup will appear when you tap a gift

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/tips/popup_confirmation_cadeau.webp" description="Confirmation popup" %}

# Bookmark a base

To find a specific base on the map, you must first save it as a favorite:

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/tips/enregistrer_favoris.webp" description="Save a base as a favorite" %}

Regardless of the favorites category, to find it again:

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/tips/recherche_favoris.webp" description="Find a favorite base" %}

# Daily free chests

There are two free chests you can claim every day that give a few diamonds.

# Promotions for paid packs

Paid packs can be purchased at a discount on another site: <a href="https://lootbar.gg/top-up/last-war-survival" target="blank">Discounted paid packs</a>.

Once the purchase is made, the site will launch the game. You will need to log in with your in-game email address and use the login code received by email to access your account. You can then select your packs, which will be added directly (depending on your purchases).

{% include translated_image.html url="packs-promo.webp" description="Available paid packs" %}

Here is the procedure to follow to use this site:

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/packs_soldes.webp" description="Link purchases of discounted packs in the game" %}

There are two buttons that are not very intuitive to start the payment:
1. This button will allow you to see the cart (especially if several packs are added);
2. This button will allow payment only for the pack currently being selected
