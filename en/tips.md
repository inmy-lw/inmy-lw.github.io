# Avoid opening gifts by accident

Opening gifts (accepting the completion of a building) yields a lot of points for the VS. So you want to have as many gifts as possible to open on Tuesday. There is a setting to prevent accidental gift openings:

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/tips/confirmation_ouverture_cadeau.webp" description="Enable confirmation when opening a gift" %}

Once this setting is enabled, this confirmation popup will appear when you tap a gift

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/tips/popup_confirmation_cadeau.webp" description="Confirmation popup" %}

# Bookmark a base

To find a specific base on the map, you must first save it as a favorite:

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/tips/enregistrer_favoris.webp" description="Save a base as a favorite" %}

Regardless of the favorites category, to find it again:

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/tips/recherche_favoris.webp" description="Find a favorite base" %}

# Daily free chests

There are two free chests you can claim every day that give a few diamonds.
