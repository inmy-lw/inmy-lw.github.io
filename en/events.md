# Different recurring events

## Train

It is possible to take the train every day. Each carriage has different types of resources. You can choose the carriage you want to travel in.

You need to hand in trade tickets (the same ones used to send UR trucks).

A carriage has 5 seats. If more than 5 people try to enter the same carriage, the passengers are chosen at random.

Once the tickets are handed in, it is possible to change carriage (by selecting a new one) until departure.
