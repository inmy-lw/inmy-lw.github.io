# Heroes management

Always focus on T1 first.

# Troop types

There are 3 troop types:

- Tank (resistant to missiles)
- Aircraft (resistant to tanks)
- Missile (resistant to aircraft)

types" %}

# Hero role

Each hero has one role among:

|                    Icon                    | Description                                |
|:------------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------|
|     ![off](/assets/img/heros/off.webp)     | Damage (can deal a lot of damage)          |
|     ![def](/assets/img/heros/def.webp)     | Defense (more resistant to injuries)       |
| ![support](/assets/img/heros/support.webp) | Support (provides various buffs to allies) |

# Team

## Team information

The team screen contains various useful information.

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/heros/team_screen.webp" description="Team composition screen" %}

1. Composition of the team (see below)
2. Team power
3. Possible composition-related boosts (see below)
4. Drone level
5. Preset of the [skill chip](/{{page.lang}}/drone-skill-chip.html)
6. Team selector

# Team composition

A team is composed of 5 heroes.

The front row soaks up damage to protect the back row.

The back row must deal enough damage to defeat the monsters.

By aligning heroes of the same troop type in one team, additional boosts are granted.

{% include translated_image.html url="heros/type_boost.webp" description="Boosts granted by aligning heroes of the same
troop type" %}

In the ideal setup, you should be able to field 3 teams:

- 1 team composed of Tank heroes
- 1 team composed of Aircraft heroes
- 1 team composed of Missile heroes

# Equipment management

Only spend resources to upgrade UR equipment!

Here are the different pieces of equipment available:
