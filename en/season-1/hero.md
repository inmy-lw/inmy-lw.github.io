# Various changes to heroes in Season 1

<a href="https://youtu.be/PrPSN235dS0?si=osze-n7pGepgSP8m" target="_blank">Explainer video</a>

## Mason becomes UR

Mason will move from SSR to UR. To promote him to UR, you will need to obtain a Legendary Hero Badge.

Using this badge will reset all of Mason’s skills to level 1.

All items (SSR fragments, skill medals, etc.) used on Mason during Season 0 will be returned via mail.

You will need to reuse those same SSR fragments to increase his grade, except their cost will be twice as high.

He will keep the same skills, notably his skill that boosts the back line of Tank heroes when fighting monsters. This will be particularly useful when capturing fortresses to deal with the many zombies.

**Note: It’s important to level him up for players with a T1 tank lineup, because Mason and Kim will have a 5% boost throughout Season 1.**

## Exclusive weapons

Three UR heroes will receive an exclusive weapon, progressively:
- Week 1: Kimberley
- Week 3: DVA
- Week 5: Tesla

These exclusive weapons will add a new tab to the hero, and their upgrading will work the same way as grades: with universal fragments or fragments specific to the hero.

**These weapons greatly increase the damage of the respective weapons.**

Exclusive weapons will be paid during Season 1; but they will become available later during the inter‑season for everyone.

### Unlocking exclusive weapons

To unlock an exclusive weapon, you need:
- the hero is 5‑star
- 50 fragments of the hero’s exclusive weapon

### Upgrading the exclusive weapon

Once the exclusive weapon is unlocked, it starts at level 1. It can be upgraded up to level 30.

| Level  | Fragments per section | Total fragments |
|:------:|:---------------------:|:---------------:|
|   1    |          50           |       50        |
|  2 - 5 |          20           |       80        |
| 6 - 10 |          40           |       200       |
| 11 - 15|          60           |       300       |
| 16 - 20|          100          |       500       |
| 21 - 25|          150          |       750       |
| 26 - 30|          200          |      1000       |

To upgrade an exclusive weapon to level 30, you therefore need a total of **2880 fragments**.

### Getting fragments

Universal fragments can be obtained from VS chests, in certain in‑game shops, and in the "Black Market" event at the end of the season.

New types of chests will appear, in which we can choose between UR fragments or exclusive weapon fragments.

## "Hero Return" tickets

In the tavern, in addition to the "Hero Recruitment" tickets and "Survivor Recruitment" tickets, a new ticket type "Hero Return" will appear, allowing you to obtain UR heroes you didn’t get (e.g., Williams).

These tickets can only be obtained during events, so they won’t be as easy to get as the existing "Hero Recruitment" tickets.
