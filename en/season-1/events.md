# Events

<a href="https://youtu.be/KQDd-cybb8Y?si=c84iX6-eueTQcknc" target="_blank">Explainer video</a>

## Events home button

A new menu will appear on the home screen, where you can access the different events of the season.

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/season-1/season-events.webp" description="Button to access the list of Season 1 events (which will appear during the season...)" %}

This button (which will only appear at the start of Season 1) will lead to a screen that summarizes the different events of the season.

## Season objectives

During this season (which will last at least 8 weeks), there will be weekly personal objectives and others for the entire alliance.

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/season-1/objectives.webp" description="Screen listing the season objectives" %}

On this summary screen you will find:
1. The duration of the season (and the status of weekly objectives) (notably increasing virus resistance, etc.)
2. Personal objectives
3. Profession-related objectives (also accessible from the [Hall of Professions](/{{page.lang}}/season-1/profession.html))

## Genetic recombination

This is a new event that is similar in principle to hidden treasures (which you get from secret tasks)
1. You will need to collect 6 different types of vials
2. Once the 6 are gathered, you can combine them to obtain a treasure
3. There is a maximum cooldown between two combinations (you cannot combine all syringes as many times as you want)
   - There are therefore enough vials to collect to be able to combine them regularly
4. These vials are obtained by defeating Cursed Elites
5. The rewards are less attractive than hidden treasures (which are still maintained during Season 1)

1. Different vials to collect
2. Cooldown for recombination

## Method for free teleportation

Similar to VS, there is a method that allows you to teleport for free during the war zone expedition.

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/season-1/free-teleport.webp" description="Free teleportation method" %}

1. Click the Season 1 button
2. Select the first card, then "Regrouping"
3. Select a different server and teleport to it
4. You will then be temporarily transported to this server
5. Return to your server for free and repeat.

**As with VS, this action can be done every 3 minutes, so it's recommended to have your shield to avoid being trapped.**
