# Map

This map is made up of very rectangular plots, all of which can be captured:

- Fortresses (unnamed, marked as ‘1’ on the image)
    - They are captured by killing a certain number of zombies (around 40 or 50)
    - A boss will then appear, and you must deal a certain amount of damage within the time limit (similar to
      the [Marshal Guard](/{{page.lang}}/regular-events.html))
    - Once the fortress is captured, the plot will be captured as well.
- Cities (named, marked as ‘2’ on the image)
    - Equivalent to the villages currently known on our current map (Season 0)
    - Capturable only if adjacent plots have already been captured.
    - Capture is similar to village capture in Season 0.
    - City capture will only be available gradually:
        - Week 1
          - Wednesday: Level 1 Cities
          - Sunday: Level 2 Cities
        - Week 2
          - Wednesday: Level 3 Cities
          - Sunday: Level 4 Cities
        - Week 3
          - Wednesday: Level 5 Cities
          - Sunday: Level 6 Cities
        - Week 4
          - Sunday: Level 7 Cities
- The path followed by the alliance is orange on the map <span style="background-color: #EC7A08;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.

**Watch your virus resistance during capture!** The rally launcher shares their resistance with all
members of the rally (unless a member has a higher resistance).

## War Zone Expedition

This event will start from week 3.

All alliances will be able to place an outpost on another server of our war duel. We can then teleport around it to defend the area while the outpost is being built.

Once this building is constructed, we will be able to teleport into this area (in the same way as the VS TPs used today on Saturdays — in Season 0) to capture fortresses and cities on the other servers.

Even if this building is destroyed, we will still be able to go to the server to capture fortresses and cities.

From the start of the event, the alliance will earn one outpost per week.

Precise teleportation will therefore always be available and not only on Saturdays (using the VS TP). There will still be the same cooldown between two uses of this TP.

Server alliances have already started to form. If a city on our server were to be attacked, our friendly servers would come to support us by attacking the conquerors’ bases.
