# Mechanics

<a href="https://youtu.be/jm5XQRq7p6M?si=mNeUNlxup2TfipWK" target="_blank">Explainer video</a>

Our base will be susceptible to a new virus.

The goal of this season is to increase our resistance to the virus as quickly as possible.

When our base is infected, our allies will be able to heal us.

# Zombie visuals

For zombies or cursed elites, you will need to have a certain resistance to the virus in order to damage them:

Since the virus resistance here (_9,500_) is lower than the required value (_10,100_), our attack will lose 12% of its
value.

# New resources

These new resources can be obtained, in particular, when a Cursed Elite level is defeated for the first time.
