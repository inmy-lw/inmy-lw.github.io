## TDH (Winter Storm)

The Winter Storm is an event that takes place every Saturday in 3 different slots:
- Saturday between 3:00 a.m. and 3:00 a.m.
- Saturday between 12:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m.
- Saturday between 8:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m.

It is a battle similar to the Desert Storm, except that it takes place with two teams of five commanders who are not necessarily part of the same alliance.

## General's Trial

This trial takes place every two weeks on Wednesdays and Thursdays.

At the beginning of the session, you choose a level that you will commit to for the rest of the session.

Choose your level carefully; ideally, you should be able to pass the first 25 levels on your own.

For the last five, you can call on the rest of the alliance by launching rallies.

## Cross-server duel (mud)

WIP

## Zombie Invasion (Golden Zombies)

This event takes place every two weeks on Wednesdays and Thursdays. The goal is to kill golden zombies on the map to uncover zombie bosses. Rewards a lot of resources.

## Celestial Battler

This event takes place once a month. It is the equivalent of a marshal on a server-wide scale.
